# SFND 2D Feature Tracking

<img src="images/keypoints.png" width="820" height="248" />

The idea of the camera course was to build a collision detection system - that's the overall goal for the Final Project. As a preparation for this, I buÄ±lt the feature tracking part and test various detector / descriptor combinations to see which ones perform best. This mid-term project consists of four parts:

* First, you will focus on loading images, setting up data structures and putting everything into a ring buffer to optimize memory load. 
* Then, you will integrate several keypoint detectors such as HARRIS, FAST, BRISK and SIFT and compare them with regard to number of keypoints and speed. 
* In the next part, you will then focus on descriptor extraction and matching using brute force and also the FLANN approach we discussed in the previous lesson. 
* In the last part, once the code framework is complete, you will test the various algorithms in different combinations and compare them with regard to some performance measures. 



** Tasks **
* MP.1 Data Buffer Optimization
   In order to prevenet pushing of computer memeory to limit, we only wanted to hold a certain number of images in memory so that when a new one arrives


* MP.2 Keypoint Detection
	Implement classical and modern detectors and make them selectable by setting a string accordingly.
    -Classical detectors:
    	HARRIS, 
   	Shi-Tomas,
    	SIFT.
        SUFT. (was not impelemented)
    
    -Modern detectors:
    	FAST,
    	BRISK,
    	ORB,
    	AKAZE
    
* MP.3 Keypoint Removal
 	Discard feature points that are not located on the preceding vehicle.
 
* MP.4 Keypoint Descriptors
	Implement HOG and Binary descriptors and make them selectable by setting a string accordingly.
    -HOG Descriptor"
    	SIFT
    -Binary Descriptors:
    	BRISK 
        BRIEF 
        ORB 
        FREAK 
        AKAZE
    
* MP.5 Descriptor Matching
	Implement Brute Force and FLANN matching as well as k-nearest neighbor selection. Both methods must be selectable using the respective strings in the main function.
    BF     -- > Binary / HOG --> NN / kNN
    FLANN  -- >       HOG    --> kNN

* MP.6 Descriptor Distance Ratio
	Use the K-Nearest-Neighbor matching to implement the descriptor distance ratio test, which looks at the ratio of best vs. second-best match to decide whether to keep an associated pair of keypoints.
    
* MP.7 Performance Evaluation 1 : Keypoints
	Count the number of keypoints on the preceding vehicle for all 10 images and take note of the distribution of their neighborhood size. Do this for all the detectors you have implemented. 
    
* MP.8 Performance Evaluation 2 : Combination of detectors and descriptors
	Count the number of matched keypoints for all 10 images using all possible combinations of detectors and descriptors. In the matching step, the FLANN approach is used with the descriptor distance ratio set to 0.8.

* MP.9 Performance Evaluation 3 : Top-3 combination 
 	Log the time it takes for keypoint detection and descriptor extraction. The results must be entered into a spreadsheet and based on this data, the TOP3 detector / descriptor combinations must be recommended as the best choice for our purpose of detecting keypoints on vehicles.
